<div align="left">

I am a full-stack developer who recently changed paths into the tech industry. The move was made because I wanted to explore new avenues and programming is one of the most versatile skills to have in today’s society. Though specialising has its benefits I lean towards broadening my understanding, this helps to see systems as a whole and not get stuck in one way of thinking. I prefer the design aspect of front-end work but am just as competent working with back-end systems.

The growth mindset promoted in the industry is something I have come to embrace, I have always been an advocate for “healthy body, health mind” and it’s nice to see that is something that the industry shares. I’m always looking to grow, working on new projects to hone my skills as a developer. I stay active in life too trying new things and learning as much as I can about people and ideas along the way, I believe I can bring this attitude to any team I become a part of.

### Flexibility    
At Makers Academy, part of the curriculum was focused on working with other developers as team. This included working with an Agile workflow and using pair programming where possible. These felt like a natural way to work as it allows for more precision in how work is distributed within teams. Collaborating on a single project using a driver and a navigator allows your workflow to run smoother and more efficiently.  

My time at Makers was spent working with a diverse group of people, each with their own individualized skill set, which required me to always take on a unique role within the team.  
I gained great management and leadership skills as well as the ability to work alone during my time at Makers. Errors are inevitable and can mean the difference between success and failure. I am confident in working through these difficult tasks alone through the debugging skills taught at Makers.            

### Communication   
Having worked with the public in my previous roles, I had had to adjust my communication skills to meet the needs of those who were non-verbal, deaf, and various other mental and physical challenges. I have, therefore, learnt to communicate effectively with my employees, managers, and customers in person, online, in writing, and on the phone.   

My experience has shown that a highly skilled team which lacks communication will always deliver a lesser product than a moderately skilled team with great communication.

## Other Interests

**Martial Arts** - For the last 14 years, I have been doing various styles of martial arts including Muay Thai, Boxing, Ju Jitsu and Wrestling. This is a significant part of my life and it has taught me discipline and humility.   
**3D Design** - From a young age I have dabbled in 3D programs such as Blender, Sketch-Up and Endorphin. Though just a hobby I have become quite adept in both hard surface and soft body modelling, at one time I even created renders of plans that were carried out on our home.   
**Motorcycles and Mechanics** - It’s been a while since I last own a bike but in the time I did I would do all maintenance myself, even going as far as to strip the engine and rebuild it.   
**Golf** - In the last couple of years I have picked up golf as a hobby. It has been the source of both great pleasure and deep frustration.
