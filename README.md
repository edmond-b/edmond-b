<div align="left">

I am a curious, dedicated, and immensely hardworking individual. My passion for software engineering means that I will always strive to achieve excellence. I possess a pragmatic attitude and have a natural affinity for communicating with people.  
As long as I can remember, I have always strived to grasp knowledge that would enable me to create bigger and better things. My problem-solving skills gained from the varied work I have done over the years are transferable and pertinent to this new venture in my life.  
I find the front-end aspect of software engineering more exciting, however, I still enjoy the other aspects of full-stack work such as back-end and databases.  
I am a big advocate for ‘healthy body, healthy mind’ and have come to embrace the growth mindset promoted by Makers and the tech industry.

### Flexibility

At Makers Academy, part of the curriculum was focused on working with other developers as team. This included working with an Agile workflow and using pair programming where possible. These felt like a natural way to work as it allows for more precision in how work is distributed within teams. Collaborating on a single project using a driver and a navigator allows your workflow to run smoother and more efficiently.  
My time at Makers was spent working with a diverse group of people, each with their own individualized skill set, which required me to always take on a unique role within the team.  
I gained great management and leadership skills as well as the ability to work alone during my time at Makers. Errors are inevitable and can mean the difference between success and failure. I am confident in working through these difficult tasks alone through the debugging skills taught at Makers.            

### Communication

Having worked with the public in my previous roles, I had had to adjust my communication skills to meet the needs of those who were non-verbal, deaf, and various other mental and physical challenges. I have, therefore, learnt to communicate effectively with my employees, managers, and customers in person, online, in writing, and on the phone.   
My experience has shown that a highly skilled team which lacks communication will always deliver a lesser product than a moderately skilled team with great communication.     

## Education

**Makers Academy**

16-week computer programming bootcamp. One of the top ranked bootcamps in London.  
Due to unfortunate event of COVID-19, Makers was forced to switch to full remote training during my time with them. Despite this, I was able to maintain the same quality of work. This has given me the confidence to work from home as well as the eagerness to get back into the office.

**Brighton University**

Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering.

I left Brighton University with a certificate of higher education in Engineering & Mathematics.

**Ealing, Hammersmith & West London College**

A-Levels: Mathematics - Biology - Physics

As: Psychology

## Other Interests

In the last 14 years, I have been doing various styles of martial arts including Muay Thai, boxing, Ju Jitsu and wrestling. This is a significant part of my life and it has taught me discipline and humility.   
Having taken up Golf in the last couple of years, I have found some tranquility (or endless frustration at times!) especially during the difficulties brought to us by the pandemic.  
Spending more time at home has also meant regular Chess games with my Father – still waiting to win though.    
As a young adult, I dabbled with animation and hard surface 3D modelling in my spare time. I have since then, taken up sketching to improve my skills in organic modelling too. More recently, I have honed my skills with Blender, doing full scene renders and trying my hand at animation.
