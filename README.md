Dear Potential Employer
I am a curious, dedicated, and immensely hardworking individual. My passion for software engineering means that I will always strive to achieve excellence. I possess a positive attitude and have a natural affinity for communicating with people.
As long as I can remember, I have always strived to grasp knowledge that would enable me to create bigger and better things. My problem-solving skills gained from the varied work I have done over the years are transferable and pertinent to this new venture in my life.
I find the front-end aspect of software engineering more exciting however I still enjoy the other aspects of full-stack work such as back-end and databases.
I am a big advocate for ‘healthy body, healthy mind’ and have come to embrace the growth mindset promoted by Makers and the tech industry.

## Skills

### Flexibility

At Makers Academy a large part of the curriculum was focused on working with other developers. This included working with an Agile workflow and also using pair programming where possible. Although this was something new to me at the time it felt like a more natural way to work as it allows for more flexibility in how work is distributed within teams and having a team member watch over your work makes your workflow run much smoother. My time at Makers was spent working with a diverse group of people that each brought a different skill set to the table. This required me to always take on different roles within the team, on occasion having to lead and other times following the ideas of my peers. As will inevitably happen however I also had to work alone in some instances. With the debugging process ingrained in me through makers I am still able to work through these difficult tasks.          

### Communication

Again this is a big part of any work involving other people. My time in retail is where I think I gained the most experience here. Having to work with people of all ages and from all walks of life. I have leant that everyone has something to bring to the table and to make the most of everyone's skill set you need to communicate. My experience has shown that a highly skilled team witch lacks communication will always deliver a lesser product than a moderately skilled team with great communication.

## Education

**Makers Academy**
(March 2020 - July 2020)
* 16 week coding bootcamp - one of the top bootcamps in London.  
This was initially meant to be an on site course however the current situation lead to us having to do the course remotely. I feel like we overcame this very well and the standard of our work was not affected very much. This has however given me the confidence to say I can work from anywhere.

**Brighton University**
(October 2014 - June 2018)
* Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering.
Circumstances at the time lead to me leaving during my third year with a certificate of higher education in Engineering & Mathematics.

**Ealing, Hammersmith & West London College**
(September 2012 - June 2014)
* Physics: B
* Biology: D
* Maths: C
* As - Psychology: A

## Experience

**_Coming Soon..._**

## Other Interests

For many years now I have been doing all types of martial arts from Muay Thai and boxing to Ju Jitsu and wrestling. This is a big part of my life and it has taught me discipline and humility.

As a teen I used to play around with animation and 3D modeling in my spare time, mostly hard surface modeling at the time as this was easiest. I later took up sketching as I wanted to get better at organic modeling too. In recent years I have taken it further and honed my skills with Blender, doing full scene renders and even trying my had at animation, thought there is some work that needs to be done there.
